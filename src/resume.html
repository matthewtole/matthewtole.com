      <p class="mb-2">I have spent my time at Dropbox focussing on the web, building out high value new features
        for our

        pushing for improved test coverage, and performing vital maintenance work on our front end code.</p>

        team leadership on behalf of my squad of seven engineers. I have mentored new members of the team and I spent
        the
        summer of 2018 mentoring an intern, working with him to ship a high visibility project on time.</p>
