      <p class="mb-2">This is the site that I built and designed for my Star Wars/Star Trek themed wedding to Katherine in June 2017.</p>
      <p>It was built using Jekyll and was originally hosted on Github Pages, but is now on Netlify.</p>

    <div class="hidden js-modal-content" data-modal-content="projects/katherinetole">
      {{ projects.modal_header("katherinetole", "katherinetole.com", "https://katherinetole.com") }}
      <p class="mb-2">My wife is a professional voice actor, and we worked together to build her the perfect website to showcase her talent.</p>
      <p>It was built using Gatsby and Bulma, and is hosted on Netlify.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="hidden js-modal-content" data-modal-content="projects/matthewtole">
      {{ projects.modal_header("matthewtole", "matthewtole.com", "https://matthewtole.com") }}
      <p class="mb-2">When I discovered <a href="https://tailwincss.com" class="text-cta hover:underline">Tailwind</a>, I fell in love with the idea, and wanted to redesign my personal website.</p>
      <p class="mb-2">I generated a color scheme for myself, and rebuilt the site from scratch, with a strong focus on responsive design, as well as keeping the site as lightweight as possible.</p>
      <p>The site is built using <a href="https://11ty.io" class="text-cta hover:underline">Eleventy</a>, based on my <a href="https://github.com/matthewtole/eleventy-tailwind-starter" class="text-cta hover:underline">personal template</a>, and is hosted on <a href="https://netlify.com" class="text-cta hover:underline">Netlify</a>.</p>

    <div class="hidden js-modal-content" data-modal-content="projects/lushmouthfeel">
      {{ projects.modal_header("lushmouthfeel", "lushmouthfeel.com", "https://lushmouthfeel.com") }}
      <p class="mb-2">While wine tasting in Eastern Washington, a tipsy joke among friends turned into an idea for a website.</p>
      <p>I built the first prototype in 30 minutes using my <a href="https://github.com/matthewtole/eleventy-tailwind-starter" class="text-cta hover:underline">Eleventy + Tailwind starter repository</a>, and I am excited to extend it further with better text generation.</p>

    <div class="hidden js-modal-content" data-modal-content="projects/catandjoe">
      {{ projects.modal_header("catandjoe", "catandjoe.wedding", "https://catandjoe.wedding") }}
      <p class="mb-2">When my best friend asked me how she should make the website for her wedding, I told her I would be delighted to make it for her.</p>
      <p>She has a strong design sense, and we collaborated on bringing the color scheme and her hand painted images from the wedding invites, into a single page site that served as the RSVP and FAQ for her big day.</p>
