Sometimes my wife will make fun of the way that I pack the dishwasher. She's not wrong - by the time she's finished moving things around they are much more efficient and more likely to come out clean. In my defense, the reason that it's disorganized is that I'm the one that's been putting items in as we use them. She comes in at the end and sees the chaos, but she has the benefit of hindsight.

I was thinking about the dishwasher the last time I was looking at someone else's code I was reviewing and wondering why they would choose to structure it like this.
