    In 2012, my coworker <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/electronicsworkshop/">Tim Ayers</a> and I took part in Empire Uncut, a fan
    recreation of Empire Strikes Back. The movie was sliced up into 15 second
    segments, and thousands of participants from across the globe picked a scene
    and created it using whatever style they liked!

    Star Wars Uncut) at

  <h2>Our Scenes</h2>
  <p>
    Tim and I chose two back-to-back scenes, so that we could double our chances
    of getting picked, but only have to work on one set of characters and
    backgrounds.
  </p>
  <p>This is a screenshot of the scene from the original film:</p>
