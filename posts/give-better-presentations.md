## Know your audience

The first step in crafting a great presentation is to know _who_ you are going to be talking to. If you're giving a presentation to the entire company, you might want to avoid going into too much technical detail, and instead focus on the business impact. But if you're just going to be sharing with fellow engineers, especially those with the same level of experience and familiarity with the systems, you can usually skip the background and get right down into details.

One very important thing to remember, brilliantly captured in this XKCD comic, is that the more of an expert you are in your field, the harder it is to remember what the average person knows.

Always err on the side of over-explaining technical topics, especially when you don't know what everyones familiarity is. Better to be sure that everyone is on the same page rather then wasting everyone's time.

## Explain the why

This is the part of presentations that I notice people skipping over all the time, and it's critical to set the scene before getting into the details of what you've done. Don't just dive in and start talking about what you built, but begin by covering the problem you were trying to solve.

### Talk about the current situation

In most situations, if you're presenting something you've built, it's either because something couldn't be done before, or because doing it before was difficult, expensive, or time consuming. If you want everyone to care about what you've spent all that time on, you need to first explain why it's better than what was there before.

If you've built a brand new tool, feature, or workflow, talk about who is going to benefit from this. Were there repeated customer requests? Was this some major gap in compliance or standards?

For improvements, make sure you explain what is so bad about the current situation. Maybe the current process is really error prone, and you've been spending a lot of time just fixing mistakes. Perhaps the current system is wasting a lot of money that doesn't need to be spent.

## Spoil the ending early

Unless you are a really experienced public speaker, trying to add dramatic tension to your presentation is hard to pull off well. You want to make sure that everyone listening at least understands the outcome of what you built, even if they neither care nor understand the technical details.

Once you've covered the background information of why you've done what you did, give a quick explaination of what you were able to build.

> With the new pipeline that we've built, reports are now automatically generated any time new data comes in, reducing the average delay from 10 hours to under 5 minutes.
