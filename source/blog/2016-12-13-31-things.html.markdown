title: 31 Things

A few weeks ago I turned 30. It turns out that I (mostly accidentally) achieved a lot of personal goals in the last year of my twenties, so it seems like a good time to take a look at where I am and where I want to be, and instead of waiting until January 1st to set myself a list of New Year's Resolutions, to give myself some goals to achieve before my next birthday.

As a big fan of arbitrarily significant numbers I picked 31 things to achieve before my 31st birthday. Some of them are easy, some of them are hard, a few are downright impossible, but I want to try and achieve them anyway.

I do not feel comfortable sharing the details of all 31 items in such a public arena, but here are just a few of them:

* Complete a marathon
* Complete a 5.10d indoor climb
* Complete a 5.10d indoor climb
* Find regular volunteering activity
* Learn a new programming language
* Take a cooking class
* Get driving license
* Write at least one blog post a month
* Visit a new country
* Go scuba diving
* Learn new skill / craft / hobby
* Read / listen to 31 books
* Visit 5 new museums / art galleries

As of writing this blog post, I have achieved 2 of of the 31 things! The only one I can talk about was "Get Married" which I did on December 1st.

Here's to completing 29 more things!
