As I have talked about in a [previous blog post](/blog/2016/12/13/31-things/), I set
myself 31 goals to achieve before I turn 31. As of the date of writing, I am a little bit over a quarter of the
way through the year, so I thought I would post an update as to how I am progressing with my goals.

Here is a super ugly graph from the Google Sheet I use to track my progress. As you can see,
I am currently a little bit ahead of where I need to be at this point in the year. Go me!

## Completed Things

I managed to check off a total of eight new goals since I wrote my [original blog post](/blog/2016/12/13/31-things/) back in early December!

### Take a cooking class

I took a Knife Skills class at [San Francisco Cooking School](https://www.sfcooking.com/) on February 19th.
I found the class to be quite basic, but I definitely learned some new skills and techniques and will be looking
at taking more classes in the future.

### Have completed personal website

I don't know if a website is every truly *completed*, I have finally gotten this site to a point where I
am happy with it.

### Release a personal side project

Earlier this month I published a tiny Node.js project called [`interactive-env`](https://github.com/matthewtole/interactive-env).

I have also been working on a web version of Codenames that can be played on a TV &amp; tablet, with some
 additional rules for more grown up parties. The code is not yet finished for 1.0 release,
 but I used it at a party last weekend to much success.

### Visit dentist

I am ashamed to admit, it had been over a decade since I last visited a dentist, but Kat
finally convinced me to go see hers. I had to get a fair amount of work done, but
I am absolutely glad I finally crossed this item off my todo list.

### Private Goals

I also completed four private goals, which if you are really curious you can always ask me about!

## Incomplete Things

I still have 21 goals left to complete in the next 9 months! Lets take a look at them
and what, if any, progress I have made so far.

### Complete a marathon

I have signed up for the San Francisco Marathon on July 23rd 2017. I began a self-guided
training plan on February 20th, and so far it's going really well. I run four times a week,
including a long run on the weekend, and do climbing and strength training on my rest days.

### Complete a 5.10d indoor climb

Kat and I usually go climbing at least once a week, and I have been climbing 5.10a
and 5.10b routes. We want to take an advanced techniques class soon so that we can
both level up our skills.

### Keep weight below 75kg for 1 month

Definitely been struggling with my eating habits over the past few months.
Current weight hovers around 91kg.

### Buy a house

This will almost certainly not happen until early 2018, but we still want to move to
either Seattle or Portland in the summer.

### Find regular volunteering activity

Honestly, it's been hard to find a volunteering role that suits both me and my schedule,
but I'm still looking.

### Learn a new programming language

I have been experimenting with both Rust and Go, but don't feel proficient enough
in either of them to claim that I have "learned" them.

### Get driving licence

No progress to report here!

### Have $50k in savings account

This goal is going to be a little harder to achieve than original anticipated. Due to
a delay in my green card application, I am currently on unpaid leave from work, which
means I am dipping into my savings account. As soon as I start earning again I will
be redoubling my efforts to save money.

### Write at least one blog post a month

I have kept up with this goal so far, having written a blog post in
[December](/blog/2016/12/13/31-things/), [January](/blog/2017/01/02/2016-in-movies/)
and now February.

### Make a new close friend

### Go to 5 new meetups

Completely failed to attend any new meetups so far, will work harder on this goal.

### Visit a new country

For our honeymoon, Kat and I will be travelling around Europe, which will include a
couple of new countries for me.

### Attend convention

Nothing to report yet.

### Go scuba diving

I was planning on doing this on the JoCo Cruise this year, but due to a delay with my
green card application, I won't be able to go. Haven't come up with a backup plan yet!

### Learn new skill / craft / hobby

I am still trying to find something that piques my interest enough to invest a lot of
time, energy and/or money in. If you have any suggestions, let me know!

### Read / listen to 31 books

So far I have read 6 books:

* [Gravity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32260.Gravity) by [Tess Gerrtisen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tess_Gerritsen)
* [Tier One](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32260.Gravity) by Brian Andrews & Jeffrey Wilson
* [The Girl With All The Gifts](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17235026-the-girl-with-all-the-gifts) by [M. R. Carey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Carey_(writer))
* [Heir of Novron](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11100431-heir-of-novron) by [Michael J Sullivan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Sullivan_(author))
* [Down and Out in Paris and London](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/393199.Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London) by [George Orwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell)
* [The Handmaid's Tale](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38447.The_Handmaid_s_Tale) by [Margaret Atwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Atwood)

### Visit 5 new museums / art galleries

Kat and I took the [SF Armory tour](http://www.armorystudios.com/tours/) in January,
which was super interesting! I still have to find four more places to visit.

### Private Goals

There are still four private goals I have yet to complete, but hoping to get one or two
of them done in the next few months!

## Summary

A few of my incomplete goals are either at risk or definitely won't be happening before
I turn 31, but overall I am very happy with my progress so far.

I will be posting again in 3 months with another update, so check back then!
